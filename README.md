# Data Science Projects
### About this repository

As a Electrical Engineer combine analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, and attention to details. Having spend the last years applying Machine Learning with courses from Data Camp ande Udemy, I developed a critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

I am currently a Master's student at University of Brasilia with researchs about signal processing and 
participation in the group of machine learning research of the electrical engineer departament. 

In this repository I will provide some notebooks I have developed.
