# Data Science Projects
### About this repository

As a Electrical Engineer combine analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, and attention to details. Having spend the last years applying Machine Learning with several courses, I developed a critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In this repository I will provide some notebooks I have developed.
